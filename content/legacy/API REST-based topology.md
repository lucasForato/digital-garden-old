# DEFINITION

This topology for [[Microservices Architecture]] is useful for websites that expose
**small, self-contained individual services** through some sort of API. In this topology, these fine-grained service components are typically accessed using a [[REST]]-based interface
implemented through a separately deployed web-based API layer.
