# DEFINITION
Concurrency refers to the ability of a system or program to handle multiple tasks or [[Processes]] <u>simultaneously</u>. It is a property of systems that allows multiple actions to occur concurrently, without one action necessarily waiting for the other to complete. In other words, it enables overlapping or parallel execution of tasks to improve efficiency and responsiveness.
