# Definition

In a LAN (Local Area Network) network, dynamic allocation of channels refers to the process of assigning communication channels or frequencies to different devices or nodes on the network dynamically. It is a method used to manage and optimize the use of available channels in order to avoid interference and ensure efficient data transmission.

Dynamic allocation of channels is **particularly important in wireless LANs (WLANs)** where multiple devices communicate over the airwaves. In such networks, the available frequency spectrum is limited and shared among different devices. To prevent collisions and interference, a mechanism is needed to allocate channels in a way that minimizes conflicts and maximizes the overall network performance.

One common approach for dynamic channel allocation in WLANs is called "Dynamic Frequency Selection" (DFS). DFS involves using a set of predefined channels and dynamically selecting the most appropriate channel for each device based on various factors such as interference levels, signal strength, and channel utilization. By continuously monitoring the network conditions, devices can detect and avoid channels that are experiencing heavy interference, thereby improving the overall quality of communication.

Dynamic channel allocation can also be used in wired LANs, although it is less common. In wired networks, it typically involves the use of techniques such as time-division multiplexing (TDM) or frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) to allocate channels or time slots to different devices dynamically based on their bandwidth requirements.

Overall, dynamic allocation of channels in LAN networks aims to optimize the use of available resources, reduce interference, and improve the efficiency of data transmission, ultimately enhancing the performance and reliability of the network.
