# Summary

Networks are a stack of layers. Each layer offers a service.

Services respect [[Protocols]] to work. If the protocol is not followed, communication may be impossible.

## [[Connection-Oriented Service]] vs [[Connectionless Service]] 

A [[Connection-Oriented Service]] works like a telephone service, they **establish** a connection, **use** the connection, and **end** the connection

A [[Connectionless Service]] is modeled after the postal service. Messages have a **sender** and a **destination**. The message is then passed down from node to node until the destination receives it.
