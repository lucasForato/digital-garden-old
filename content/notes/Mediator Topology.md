# Definition

The mediator topology is useful for events that have **multiple steps** and require some level of orchestration to process the event.

## Main Concepts

The main idea behind the mediator topology is having a central component called the [[Mediator]] which is responsible for sitting between service components, these components communicate with each other <u>through the mediator.</u> The mediator acts as a hub or a central point of control for communication.
