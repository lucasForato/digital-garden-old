title: "Static Design"

# Definition
A typical static allocation would be to divide time into discrete intervals and use a [[Round-robin algorithm]], allowing each machine to broadcast only when its time slot comes up.

Static allocation wastes channel, because not all computers on the network are going to be used all the time, so the channel has time slots that are not being used.
