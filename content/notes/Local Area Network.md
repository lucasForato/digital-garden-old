## Wireless
There is a standard for wireless known as **WiFi**.

## Wired
Compared to wireless, wired networks exceed in speed. It is like when you connect a computer to your home network through cables, it is going to be much faster than when you connect to it by air (wireless).

A widespread topology for wired connections is called **Ethernet.

### Ethernet
In this topology, many computers are connected to a device called a **switch**, the switch has many ports that are connected to each computer, the job of the switch is receiving and sending packets  through the network. Two or more switches can be connected to each other to offer more ports to connect to more computers.
