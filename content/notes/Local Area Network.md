# Definition

**Local Area Network (LAN)** is a network that operates in a single building, like a house or an office, it connects all computers in that building.

Local area networks can be built using **Wireless** or **Cables**.

## Access Point

The access point is the central device that distributes packets across all devices.

## Wireless

There is a standard for wireless known as **WiFi**.

Wireless can be divided into two categories based on how the channel is allocated:

[[Static Design]]

[[Dynamic Design]]

## Wired

Compared to wireless, wired networks exceed in speed. It is like when you connect a computer to your home network through cables, it is going to be much faster than when you connect to it by air (wireless).

A widespread topology for wired connections is called **Ethernet.

Wired networks can also be divided into two categories based on how the channel is allocated:

### Ethernet

In this topology, many computers are connected to a device called a **switch**, the switch has many ports that are connected to each computer, the job of the switch is receiving and sending packets  through the network. Two or more switches can be connected to each other to offer more ports to connect to more computers.

It is possible to create a **VLAN** or **Virtual LAN**, which colors the ports of the switch in specific color codes, where one color does not interact with another color, as if they were in different **LANs**.
