# Definition

topic queue, also known as a message queue, is a data structure that manages the order and delivery of messages within a messaging system. It is commonly used in distributed systems and communication protocols to enable asynchronous communication between different components or services.

In a topic queue, messages are sent by a producer and received by one or more consumers. The producer adds messages to the queue, and the consumers retrieve messages from the queue in the order they were added. This allows for decoupling and independent processing of messages, as producers and consumers don't need to interact directly or be available at the same time.
