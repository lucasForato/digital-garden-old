# Introduction

Recently, I've dedicated myself to a comprehensive study of architecture patterns, recognizing their importance within the realm of backend software engineering. I embarked on this journey by exploring relevant content on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend). Then I came across a great book on the topic entitled "Software Architecture Patterns - Mark Richards". I'm here to share some of the key takeaways from my studies. Feel free to explore the links if you wish to dive into other topics.
