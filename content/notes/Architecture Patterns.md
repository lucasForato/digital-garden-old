# Introduction

Recently, I've dedicated myself to a comprehensive study of architecture patterns, recognizing their importance within the realm of backend software engineering. I embarked on this journey by exploring relevant content on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend). Then I came across a great book on the topic entitled **"Software Architecture Patterns - Mark Richards"**. I'm here to share some of the key takeaways from my studies. Feel free to explore the links if you wish to dive into other topics.

## Layered Architecture

[[Layered Architecture]]

The first pattern I want to talk about is the **layered architecture** pattern. This pattern is the standard for most Java EE applications and therefore is widely known by most architects, designers, and developers.

A layered architecture consists of many **horizontal layers** that each take care of one specific task, this makes it possible to isolate changes to specific components in the architecture.

## Event-driven Architecture

[[Event-driven Architecture]]

In this architecture, the system is built around handling and responding to [[Event|events]]. Instead of executing a predefined sequence of steps, the system listens for [[Event|events]] and reacts accordingly. Events propagate in the system through the [[Pub-Sub Pattern]]


## Microkernel Architecture

## Microservices Architecture

## Space-based Architecture
