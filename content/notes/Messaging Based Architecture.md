# DEFINITION

A messaging-based architecture is a design approach where systems communicate by **sending messages** to each other. Instead of directly calling methods or services, components exchange messages through a messaging infrastructure. This approach promotes loose coupling, scalability, and fault tolerance, allowing systems to communicate asynchronously and enabling integration between diverse applications.
