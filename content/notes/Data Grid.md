In a [[Space-based Architecture]], a data grid refers to a distributed and scalable data storage and processing system that spans multiple nodes or servers in a network. It is designed to handle large volumes of data and provide high-performance access and manipulation capabilities.

## FEATURES
One of the key features of a data grid is its ability to handle data locality and distribution transparently. Data is typically replicated across multiple nodes to provide fault tolerance and high availability. The data grid also supports dynamic data partitioning and load balancing, allowing it to scale horizontally by adding or removing nodes as needed.
