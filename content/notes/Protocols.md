# Definition
Protocols are a set of rules that govern how services interact with each other.

## Analogy
In society, when a woman is introduced to a man, she may choose to stick her hand. He, in turn, might choose to kiss it if she is a princess or shake it if she is a lawyer. If none is chosen, communication might not work properly.
