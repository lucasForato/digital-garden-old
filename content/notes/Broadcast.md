# Definition

The communication channel is shared by all machines on the network. Packets sent by one machine are received by all the others. Packets inform their destination, so that only the correct machine processes the packet.

If a packet has a specific code on the receiver address, it can be received by all machines on the network, this is called **broadcasting**.

# Examples

Wireless is a good example of a broadcast link.
