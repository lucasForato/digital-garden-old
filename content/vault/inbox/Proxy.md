# DEFINITION
A proxy acts as a bridge between the client and the server. The proxy receives the requests and forwards it to the target server, retrieving the response that needs to be sent to the client.

## BENEFITS
1. **Anonymity and Privacy**: Proxies can mask the client's IP address, making it difficult for the target server to identify the actual source of the request. This feature is often used to enhance privacy and maintain anonymity while browsing the internet.

2. **Content Filtering**: Proxies can be configured to filter or block certain types of content, allowing organizations to control and monitor the resources accessed by their network users. This feature is commonly employed in workplaces, schools, and public networks to enforce internet usage policies.

3. **Caching**: Proxies can cache frequently accessed resources locally, storing a copy of the requested content. When subsequent requests for the same resource are made, the proxy can serve the cached version instead of retrieving it from the target server. Caching improves response times and reduces bandwidth usage.

4. **Load Balancing**: Proxies can distribute incoming client requests across multiple servers to balance the load and ensure efficient resource utilization. This approach helps enhance the performance, scalability, and availability of the target servers.

5. **Security**: Proxies can act as a barrier between the client and the target server, providing an additional layer of security. They can filter out malicious traffic, block certain types of attacks, and provide SSL encryption to protect sensitive data transmitted between the client and the server.
