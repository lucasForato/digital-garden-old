# DEFINITION
The adapter will act as a bridge that connects the [[Plugins]] to the [[Core]] of the [[Microkernel Architecture]]. The adapter makes sure that both APIs can understand each others contract.

---
## WHEN TO USE
The adapter should be used when you are not really sure the contract that a specific [[Plugins]] will have because they will be developed by third-party.
