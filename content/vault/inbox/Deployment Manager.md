# DEFINITION

The deployment-manager component manages the dynamic startup and shutdown of [[Processing Unit|processing units]] based on load conditions. This component continually monitors response times and user loads, and starts up new processing units when load increases, and shuts down processing units when the load decreases. It is a **critical component** to achieving variable scalability needs within an application.
