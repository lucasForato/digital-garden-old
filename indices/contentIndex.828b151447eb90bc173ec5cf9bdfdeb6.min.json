I embarked on this journey by exploring relevant content on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend). Then I came across a great book on the topic entitled \"Software Architecture Patterns - Mark Richards\". I'm here to share some of the key takeaways from my studies. Feel free to explore the links if you wish to dive into other topics.\n\n## [[notes/Layered Architecture|Layered Architecture]]\n\nThe first pattern I want to talk about is the layered architecture pattern. This pattern is the standard for most Java EE applications and therefore is widely known by most architects, designers, and developers.\n\nA layered architecture consists of many **horizontal layers** that each take care of one specific task, this makes it possible to isolate changes to specific components.\n\n## [[Event-driven Architecture]]\nIn this architecture, the system is built around handling and responding to [[Event|events]]. Instead of executing a predefined sequence of steps, the system listens for [[Event|events]] and reacts accordingly.

It is a method used to manage and optimize the use of available channels in order to avoid interference and ensure efficient data transmission.\n\nDynamic allocation of channels is **particularly important in wireless LANs (WLANs)** where multiple devices communicate over the airwaves. In such networks, the available frequency spectrum is limited and shared among different devices. To prevent collisions and interference, a mechanism is needed to allocate channels in a way that minimizes conflicts and maximizes the overall network performance.\n\nOne common approach for dynamic channel allocation in WLANs is called \"Dynamic Frequency Selection\" (DFS). DFS involves using a set of predefined channels and dynamically selecting the most appropriate channel for each device based on various factors such as interference levels, signal strength, and channel utilization. By continuously monitoring the network conditions, devices can detect and avoid channels that are experiencing heavy interference, thereby improving the overall quality of communication.\n\nDynamic channel allocation can also be used in wired LANs, although it is less common. In wired networks, it typically involves the use of techniques such as time-division multiplexing (TDM) or frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) to allocate channels or time slots to different devices dynamically based on their bandwidth requirements.\n\nOverall, dynamic allocation of channels in LAN networks aims to optimize the use of available resources, reduce interference, and improve the efficiency of data transmission, ultimately enhancing the performance and reliability of the network.\n\n#work-in-progress ","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T12:28:50.716573319Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Event":{"title":"Event","content":"\n## Definition\n\nAn event can be thought of as a **trigger** or **notification** that something has happened or changed in the system.

It works by assigning a fixed time quantum or time slice to each process in a cyclic manner. Each process is allowed to execute for a specified time quantum, and then it is preempted, allowing the next process in the queue to execute.\n\nIn the context of computer networks, the round-robin algorithm divides time for each computer connected to the channel, so each computer can receive **packets** for the amount of time allocated to it in a queue manner. \n\nThe algorithm operates based on a circular queue or a ready queue, where processes are placed in a particular order. When a process has completed its time quantum, it is moved to the end of the queue, and the next process in line gets a chance to execute.
